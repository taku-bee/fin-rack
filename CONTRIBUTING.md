## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Clone your forked repository locally:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
  ```
### 2. Set Up the Development Environment
- Follow the instructions in the README.md file to set up your development environment.
- Make sure to install any required dependencies and run the necessary configurations before beginning your work.

### 3. Create a New Branch
- Create a branch for your work. Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your changes (e.g., fix-calculation-bug or feature-add-chart).
  ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
  ```

### 4. Follow Coding Standards
- Write clear, well-documented, and maintainable code.
- Use consistent formatting and naming conventions. Check for any specific guidelines in the repositoryâ€™s .editorconfig or STYLE.md file.
- Write commit messages that are concise and descriptive. Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

### 5. Testing
- Test your code thoroughly. For bug fixes, confirm that your changes resolve the issue without causing regressions.
- If you are adding a new feature, please write unit tests to cover your code. Include test cases in the /tests directory, if available.
- Run all tests to ensure they pass before submitting your contribution.

### 6. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

- Go to the original repository and open a Pull Request from your branch.
- In your PR description, provide a clear explanation of the changes. Link to any relevant issues or feature requests.
- Ensure that your PR only includes changes related to a single issue or feature. Open separate PRs for unrelated changes.

### 7. Participate in the Code Review Process
